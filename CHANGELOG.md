## v0.1.0 - 2026-08-31

### MVP — selection visible in one session

- Added the voxel world: 128×64×128 layered fBm terrain, chunked culled-face rendering,
  lattice-hopping ants with instanced rendering and motion interpolation.
- Added the ecology: energy economy, digging with conserved spoil, two blank pheromone
  channels plus food scent, density-governed food spawn, corpses persisting as food.
- Added heritable behavior: a fixed-topology RNN controller behind the pluggable
  controller contract, chemotaxis-seeded wide-prior founders, a seven-gene physical
  genome on energy tradeoffs, mutation and recombination at egg creation.
- Added the colony: a scripted polyandrous queen, edible incubating eggs hatching
  juveniles, per-patriline delivery bookkeeping, and in-place merit-weighted royal
  succession.
- Added instrumentation: live selection-differential bars, population and patriline-share
  charts, gene-mean sparklines, patriline-colored ants, and a click-to-inspect ant panel.
- Added persistence: deterministic checkpoints to IndexedDB and JSON file export/import;
  seed control and speed presets up to charts-only mode.
