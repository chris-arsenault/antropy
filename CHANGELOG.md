## v0.2.0 - 2026-09-02

### Release 2 — metapopulation and recurrent regimes

- Added real colony founding: provisioned queens lay merit-fathered queen eggs; hatched
  queens fly, mate with living males (who die), and found claustrally with an entrance
  shaft; queens age and starve, collapsing their colonies. In-place succession removed.
- Added expressed haploid males: workers lay unfertilized male eggs from their own energy;
  males walk, live short, and carry whole-genome gametes into new colonies.
- Replaced the meal tax with physical provisioning: food-voxel transport plus scripted
  bidirectional trophallaxis at the queen — the stockpile is a real energy buffer and
  delivery merit is earned, not imputed.
- Added path-integration home sense, nest scent, and colony-tagged pheromone channels so
  multiple colonies coexist without cross-reading signals.
- Added nest decay (untrafficked tunnels collapse to loose fill), egg exposure hazards,
  and an oscillating seasonal carrying capacity on a widened 192×64×192 map.
- Added colony-count chart and metapopulation counters; checkpoints bumped to version 2
  (older saves are refused).

## v0.1.0 - 2026-08-31

### MVP — selection visible in one session

- Added the voxel world: 128×64×128 layered fBm terrain, chunked culled-face rendering,
  lattice-hopping ants with instanced rendering and motion interpolation.
- Added the ecology: energy economy, digging with conserved spoil, two blank pheromone
  channels plus food scent, density-governed food spawn, corpses persisting as food.
- Added heritable behavior: a fixed-topology RNN controller behind the pluggable
  controller contract, chemotaxis-seeded wide-prior founders, a seven-gene physical
  genome on energy tradeoffs, mutation and recombination at egg creation.
- Added the colony: a scripted polyandrous queen, edible incubating eggs hatching
  juveniles, per-patriline delivery bookkeeping, and in-place merit-weighted royal
  succession.
- Added instrumentation: live selection-differential bars, population and patriline-share
  charts, gene-mean sparklines, patriline-colored ants, and a click-to-inspect ant panel.
- Added persistence: deterministic checkpoints to IndexedDB and JSON file export/import;
  seed control and speed presets up to charts-only mode.
